# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
> Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines (or Index).

 * [Index](./index.md).
 * [Dark Souls I or Dark Souls I: Remastered](./ds1.md).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.md).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.md).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.md).
 
Obviously, _Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ have no difference ingame as to what a SL1 runs requires. There is also not a big difference either on that aspect for _Dark Souls II_ and the _Scholar of the First Sin_ edition, but most runners prefer to use the original _Dark Souls II_.

## DeS - SL1 Requirements

For SL1 Slayer we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:

* All Bosses - Empty arena / Souls

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._

## Acceptable SL1 Monumental Criteria

- SL1 NG+5
- SL1 No Rolling/Blocking/Parrying
- SL1 +0 Weapons, Normal Upgrade Path, No Bleed, No Toxic, No Poison
- SL1 Deathless
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God. 
- SL1 Not Hit
  - Record the full run. 
  - Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God.
- SL1 Blindfolded
  - Not allowed to see the screen, you need a clear webcam stream to prove. 
- SL1 Fist only
- SL1 Zero Weapon Durability _(Also called broken weapon run.)_

## SL1 Monumental Banned Equipment and Strategies

* Morion Blade. It's too strong. It is allowed, however and for now, to be used against Allant on higher NGs.
* Clever Rat Ring on base NG. It's too strong.
* Second Chance. It's cheap, granting a second opportunity in the middle of a fight.
* Biorr of the Twin Fangs against Penetrator. Just don't unlock his cell in 1-2.
* Thief Ring. It's too strong on bosses like Old Hero or Storm King (you are free to use when getting to the boss fog).
* Offensive spells/miracles (which you can hardly cast). 
* Multiple cheese tactics or exploits exclusive to this game. In example, using the bow glitch for Maneaters (shooting through the fog) or killing Vanguard (4-1) out of his aggro range.
