<p><strong>GENERAL SL1 In-depth Rules and Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>You can get SL1/BL4 roles in the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demon’s Souls</li>
<li>Dark Souls or Dark Souls: Remastered</li>
<li>Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin</li>
<li>Bloodborne</li>
<li>Dark Souls III</li>
</ul>
<p>Dark Souls II and Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin are seen as equal in value. Most runners prefer to use vanilla.</p>
<p><strong>Banned Criteria</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>No summons and/or any help from NPCs (players, NPCs, etc) to help in combat against bosses, unless it is unavoidable. (<em>This doesn’t mean you can’t do Sirris’ or Anri’s quest as being summoned into another world for NPC quests is fine. But remember these don’t count as a boss fight for your own world, meaning it isn’t part of your run</em>).</li>
<li>Not allowed to own items before it’s possible to obtain them <em>unless it’s part of an</em> <strong>Acceptable SL1 Legend Run</strong> <em>or if you received permission from the Mods. e.g. When you’ve reached Dark Souls III’s Undead Settlement in NG, you can trade or spawn in a Flamberge so you don’t have to farm it. Doing so prior to Undead Settlement is unacceptable without permission.</em></li>
<li>No cheating and cheesing during gameplay. <em>Please</em> ask if you are uncertain about what's disallowed and we’ll guide you to what is allowed. (<em>Turning on iframes, tumblebuffing, killing bosses outside of their arena, messing with stats, breaking the AI so it cannot harm you or anything similar is obviously not legit</em>).</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="For_SL1_Champion_16"></a><strong>For SL1 Champion</strong>:</h3>
<p>You need to beat all boss fights including DLC then show proof.</p>
<p>Either:<br>
<strong>A)</strong> Record a video of you showing stats and boss souls, boss key items and bonfires/empty arenas to prove you've defeated each of them.<br>
<strong>B)</strong> Make full screen screenshots (i.e. no cropping or editing images) of your stats, boss souls, boss key items and bonfires/empty arenas to prove you've defeated each of them.</p>
<p>If you happen to use any boss souls for gear, just show them in your inventory.</p>
<h3><a id="For_SL1_Legend_26"></a><strong>For SL1 Legend:</strong></h3>
<p>Legend runs are SL1 runs with a handicap to make it even harder. Check the page of each game for a list of what counts and doesn’t count as a Legendary run. When in doubt, ask the mods.</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to beat and record/stream all boss fights including DLC (unless the run says Any%). It’s recommended that you start the recording of the footage before you enter the boss fog. (If the run is Any% you just have to beat the game instead of beating every boss).</li>
<li>If you are streaming or recording an entire run, please provide timestamps as we’re expected to check boss kills. If you don’t take the small amount of time to timestamp your bosses, then it might take longer for your run to be verified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check if this is okay with the @Mods before you start the run, just incase there’s any issues and so you don’t have to potential re-do the run correctly because of a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3><a id="For_SL1_Lord_of_Legends_34"></a><strong>For SL1 Lord of Legends:</strong></h3>
<p>Collect all three SL1 Legend roles for each Dark Souls game. (SL1 Monumental of Demon’s Souls and BL4 Great One of Bloodborne are not required to obtain this role).</p>
<h2>Speediest SL1/BL4</h2>
<p>You may earn a special role if you're the fastest person in the server to beat SL1/BL4 All Bosses in any of the games. 
But if someone beats you, you lose that role!</p>
