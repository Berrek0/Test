# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
>Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines.

 * [Demon's Souls](./demonssouls.html).
 * [Dark Souls I or Dark Souls: Remastered](./ds1.html).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.html).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.html).
 * [Bloodborne](./bloodborne.html).
 
Obviously, _Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ have no difference ingame as to what a SL1 runs requires. There is also not a big difference either on that aspect for _Dark Souls 2_ and the _Scholar of the First Sin_ edition, but most runners prefer to use the original _Dark Souls II_.

### Banned Criteria

* Any kind of help via summoning players or NPCs is not acceptable. The run will be disqualified because of this. This rule doesn't mean you can't do Sirris' or Anri's quest since you are summoned into their world for their quests (these are not your bossfights, so they don't count). For the situation with Biorr of the Twin Fangs, check the Demon's Souls page.

* Unless it's forced by the type of run, it is not allowed to obtain items before it's possible. In example, giving yourself a boss weapon as soon as you start a normal SL1/BL4 run is unacceptable and will result in a disqualification.
 * Exceptions: 
  * Ask the server mods for discussion and/or permission if there is the possibility of such.
  * Normally it is accepted to use Cheat Engine to give yourself items for a Legend run. In example, giving yourself a torch as soon as you start the game to complete a Torch-only run.

* Cheating and cheesing during gameplay is strictly not allowed. Turning on iframes, tumblebuffing, kills outside the bosses' arenas, messing with the stats, breaking the AI so it becomes unable to harm you... None of this, and similar, will result in a disqualification. Please ask if you are uncertain about what is allowed and what isn't.
