# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
> Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines (or Index).

 * [Index](./index.md).
 * [Demon's Souls](./des.md).
 * [Dark Souls I or Dark Souls I: Remastered](./ds1.md).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.md).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.md).
 
Obviously, _Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ have no difference ingame as to what a SL1 runs requires. There is also not a big difference either on that aspect for _Dark Souls II_ and the _Scholar of the First Sin_ edition, but most runners prefer to use the original _Dark Souls II_.

## DS2 & DS2:SotFS - SL1 Requirements

**For SL1 Champion we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:**

* Aldia - Defeat Dialogue AND the visible choice to pick _'Leave Throne'_.
* Ancient Dragon - Empty arena
* Cerah, Varg and Graverobber - Flower Skirt / Empty Arena
* Blue Smelter Demon - Pharros Mask / Aged Smelter Sword / Empty Arena
* All Boss Souls and/or their bonfires/empty arenas

**Vendrick has to be included.**

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._


## DS2 & DS2:SotFS - SL1 Resources

Advices provided by Xerieh:

1. Use Dagger until having the Mace available. Then, use Mace until obtaining Rapier. Combine Rapier with Cale's Helm and Work Hook.
2. Go to the start of the Iron King DLC as soon as possible so you can get the Dexterity Ring. You don't want to lose Agility if you are rolling.
3. You can use Homunculus Mace with the Strength Ring (or Mace if you don't have this ring) for bosses such as Dragonrider (or Twins), Smelter Demons, Mirror Knight, Ruin Sentinels, Skeleton Lords, Fume Knight, and Elana's Velstadt/Skeletons.

## Acceptable SL1 Legend Criteria
> _CoC_ means you have to be in the _Company of Champions_ covenant. Ignore this requirement for Darklurker since it is not possible to fight it without changing covenant.
