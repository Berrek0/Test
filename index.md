# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
>Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines.

 * [Demon's Souls](./demonssouls.html).
 * [Dark Souls I or Dark Souls: Remastered](./ds1.html).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.html).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.html).
 * [Bloodborne](./bloodborne.html).
 
Obviously, _Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ have no difference ingame as to what a SL1 runs requires. There is also not a big difference either on that aspect for _Dark Souls 2_ and the _Scholar of the First Sin_ edition, but most runners prefer to use the original _Dark Souls II_.


Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
