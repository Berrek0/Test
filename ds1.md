# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
> Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines (or Index).

 * [Index](./index.md).
 * [Demon's Souls](./des.md).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.md).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.md).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.md).
 
Obviously, _Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ have no difference ingame as to what a SL1 runs requires. There is also not a big difference either on that aspect for _Dark Souls II_ and the _Scholar of the First Sin_ edition, but most runners prefer to use the original _Dark Souls II_.

## DS1 & DS1:R - SL1 Requirements

**For SL1 Champion we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:**

* Stray Demon - Empty arena
* Taurus Demon - Empty arena
* Bell Gargoyles - Empty arena
* Capra Demon - Key to the Depths / Empty Arena
* Gaping Dragon - Key to Blighttown / Empty arena
* Demon Firesage - Demon's Catalyst / Empty arena
* Centipede Demon - Empty arena
* Black Dragon Kalameet - Calamity Ring / Empty arena
* All Boss Souls and/or their bonfires/empty arenas

**As long as the run allows it, cheesing Bed of Chaos and Ceaseless Discharge is fine.**

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._


## DS1 & DS1:R - SL1 Resources

Generally, Reinforced Club is your main weapon for most if not all the game. Eventually it is recommended to upgrade it to a Chaos Reinforced Club -and possibly a Lightning Reinforced Club if you don't want to or can't use Blacksmith Giant Hammer-. Using fire damage for early game and then upgrade to Chaos is fine. Mentioned before, Blacksmtih Giant Hammer is the other most recommended weapon, so alternating between them based on boss resistances is optimal.
