# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
> Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines (or Index).

 * [Index](./index.md).
 * [Dark Souls I or Dark Souls I: Remastered](./ds1.md).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.md).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.md).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.md).
 
Obviously, _Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ have no difference ingame as to what a SL1 runs requires. There is also not a big difference either on that aspect for _Dark Souls II_ and the _Scholar of the First Sin_ edition, but most runners prefer to use the original _Dark Souls II_.

## DARK SOULS - SL1 Guides and Resources

Rules/Guidelines:

For Demon's Souls we require the following bosses to be defeated:

Phalanx, Tower Knight, Penetrator, Allant

Leechmonger, Dirty Colossus, Astraea

Fools Idol, Maneaters, Old Monk

Adjudicator, Old Hero, Storm King

Armored Spider, Flamelurker, Dragon God

Vanguard (either tutorial or in 4-1, please fight Vanguard (aggroing him) instead of going for the cheap magic/bow tactics.)

True Allant
