# Soulsborne SL1/BL4 Guidelines
> Roles are obtainable for all Soulsborne games. Click the list below to go to the different game guidelines (or Index).

 * [Index](./index.md).
 * [Dark Souls I or Dark Souls I: Remastered](./ds1.md).
 * [Dark Souls II or Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin](./ds2.md).
 * [Dark Souls III](./ds3.md).
 * [Bloodborne](./bb.md).
 
Obviously, _Dark Souls I_ and _Dark Souls: Remastered_ have no difference ingame as to what a SL1 runs requires. There is also not a big difference either on that aspect for _Dark Souls II_ and the _Scholar of the First Sin_ edition, but most runners prefer to use the original _Dark Souls II_.

## DeS - SL1 Requirements

For SL1 Slayer we require all bosses to be defeated with screenshots/videos of the following:

* All Bosses - Empty arena / Souls

_If you used any boss souls for items, show them as well for proof. It is strongly recommended to not use boss souls just for souls, as you are effectively destroying your own SL1 proof._

## Acceptable SL1 Monumental Criteria

* SL1 NG+5
* SL1 No Rolling/Blocking/Parrying run
* SL1 +0 Weapons, Normal Upgrade Path, No Bleed, No Toxic, No Poison run
* SL1 Deathless run - Record all of the run (Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God)
* SL1 Not Hit Run - Record all of the run (Ignore dying to Journey to the Nexus’ Dragon God)
* SL1 Blindfolded run - Not allowed to see the screen, needs a clear webcam stream to prove
* SL1 Fist only
* SL1 Zero Weapon Durability - e.g. the weapon is broken, also called “Broken Weapon run”

## SL1 Monumental Banned Equipment and Strategies

Usage of Morion Blade - It's too strong
Usage of Second Chance - It's too strong
Usage of the Thief Ring - It's too strong on certain bosses
Usage of offensive magic - It's too strong
Multiple cheese tactics or exploits. In example, using the bow glitch for Maneaters (shooting through the fog) or killing Vanguard (4-1) out of his aggro range.
